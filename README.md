- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Georgakopoulos.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development with the use of html, css, javascript and various frameworks and libraries.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React.js. I am building a portfolio with emphasis on React.js Apps. 
      Also, building fancy websites with the use of Reactstrap, Bootstrap 4 and the (slowly dying, but still useful) jQuery 
- 💞️ I’m looking for a job as junior front-end developer.
- 📫 How to reach me: c.georgak727@gmail.com
